@title Higher Kinded Types, Higher Rank Types and Higher Rank Kinds

Just writing this as a bit of a reference. I can never remember off the top of my head which of these is which. Nor can I remember what each is useful for.

## Higher Kinded Types

HKT's are in my opinion the most simple, or perhaps just the most common. They are essentially a means of parameterising a type with another type. Similar to how generics work with functions.
